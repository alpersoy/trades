This repository consists of the many trading strategies I used in the last 6 years. I have decided to upload the codes I used to github as I am pursuing professional career opportunities in this field now.

In the Google Sheets file below you can find a list of all strategies are identified under different categories including:
- Asset Type
- Time Frame
- Direction

A few words explaining the core idea of each strategy is also included in the file.

The codes in this repository are for backtesting purposes. The actual codes used for automated training are not included here as they contain API connections with the relevant exchanges. The codes assumes the data is provided in the necessary format and time frame.
